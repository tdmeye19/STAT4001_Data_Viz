# Question 1: Using the SLU Majors data set, give an example of a situation where you would construct a static graph instead of an interactive graph. Why would the static graph be better?

You would want a static graph versus an interactive graph when you are simply trying
to look at one major say Econ, and the minors Econ majors have. It would be better because it is more user-friendly, and easier to share with others.

# Question 2: Consider this version of the Tennis App from class.

```{r}
library(shiny); library(tidyverse)
atp_df <- read_csv("data/atp_matches_2019.csv")
wta_df <- read_csv("data/wta_matches_2019.csv")
both_df <- bind_rows(atp_df, wta_df)

both_long <- both_df %>% pivot_longer(c(winner_name, loser_name))

## only keep players who have player over 50 matches
both_n50 <- both_long %>% group_by(value) %>% count() %>%
  filter(n > 50)

## construct various statistics
major_tennis <- semi_join(both_long, both_n50, by = c("value"))
major_tennis <- major_tennis %>% mutate(w_svperc = 100 * w_1stIn / w_svpt,
                        l_svperc = 100 * l_1stIn / l_svpt,

```

Add a plot below the histogram that is a side-by-side boxplot for comparing a serving statistic of two players. The user should be able to select the two players as well as the statistic being compared.

Hint: You’ll need to create both a new input (for the second player) and a new output (for the second graph).

Hint 2: The histogram may now have data from both players. There is no need to fix this so that it only shows one player’s stats.
